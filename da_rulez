commit changes to files only once you have finished a significant portion of code.
pull before pushing changes to ensure that you are up to date with your respective branch.
give others a heads up that you are merging your branch with main (when relevant). this ensures that unexpected changes do not occur and create surprises.
if multiple people are working on the same file, clarify which chunks are being worked by whom. this prevents merge errors.
